MobiApps Collection

This repository contains the source code of the majority of the apps I wrote for the BlackBerry PlayBook. A few of these apps contain open source code from other sources. These are all (as of July 2013) still available on BlackBerry App World.

App Listing.xlsx contains the App World ID numbers and descriptions of most of the apps.

The Tools directory contains the scripts (for Mac) I used to compile and deploy the apps on the simulator and sign them for release. You will need to change the variables, paths, and certificate passwords prior to using them. Keep in mind, these were written in 2011, so they may or may not still be compatible with the current version of bbwp.

Enjoy!
